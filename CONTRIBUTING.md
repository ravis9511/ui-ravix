# Introduction

Thank you for your interest in contributing to ravixUI!

At this stage of the project, I am still working on the basic aspects of ravixUI and currently not accepting any pull requests at this point in time. However, I am open to suggestions, ideas, accessibility improvements and requests for new components and features which you can open a discussion for.

## Bug Reporting and Issues

I ask you to investigate carefully, collect information and describe the issue in detail in your report. Please complete the following steps in advance to help us fix any potential bug as fast as possible.

These are some checks you can do before reporting any issues or bugs :

- Make sure that you are using the latest version of Astrojs and Tailwind.
- Check other open issues to see if the issue has already been reported.

Mention the following information in your report:

- Description of the bug or issue, with expected behaviour and actual behaviour and steps to reproduce the behaviour.
- If encountered on Desktop, browser version and operating system. For smartphones, OS with version, browser with version. (If tailwind styles are applying but looks different from expected behaviour, check if you are overriding defaults with chrome flags or night mode in some chromium based browsers)
- Steps to reproduce the bug.
- The version of Astrojs and Tailwind you encounter the bug.
- Rendering mode where you encounter the issue (SSG, SSR, Hybrid) and the deployment platform in case it is SSR or Hybrid (Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare, etc.)

## Requests For New Components

Feel free to open up a discussion for a new component or feature request for already existing components.
