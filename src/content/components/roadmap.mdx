# Roadmap

This is a probable roadmap for the project. It is not a definitive roadmap and is subject to change.

- Component upgrades for major version changes for either Astrojs or Tailwind if required.
- Forms.
- Figma Design Guide.
- Unit Testing for components using Astro Container API and Vitest.
- In depth user guides.
- Navbar styles.
- Accordion Web Component With Complex Content (Current version only supports text content)
- Svelte components replicating the functionality of the existing components.
- Component blocks (multiple components which together form a single component block like Hero, Collections, Blog Post Templates, etc.)

Certain components which are planned for future releases are the following :

- Blockquote
- Sidebar and Drawers
- Skip links
- Toast/ Notification
- Tooltips
- Sliders
- Tree View
- Scrollspy
- Popover
- Chat Bubbles
