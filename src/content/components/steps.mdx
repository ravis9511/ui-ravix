# Steps

Steps can be used in multiple ways, but they are most commonly used to present a series of steps that a user must finish in order to complete a task or achieve a goal. They can be used to guide users through a process, to provide feedback on their progress, or to indicate the current step in a multi-step process.

<Accordion
  data={[
    {
      name: "steps1",
      title: "Design Hints",
      content:
        "Steps are a powerful tool for enhancing the user experience. It gives the user a clear indication of the user's progress, an approximate length of the process and a quick way to navigate back to previous steps in case they need to make changes.",
    },
    {
      name: "steps1",
      title: "Accessiblity Hints",
      content:
        "For accessibility, it is important to ensure that the steps are keyboard accessible. This can be achieved by using the `tabindex` attribute to make the steps focusable and using the `aria-current` attribute to indicate the current step. Additionally, it is important to ensure that the steps are not used as a button element and that they are not used as an input element.",

## Simple Static Steps

A simple horizontal stepper that can be used to present a series of steps and current step.

<Tab tabs={[{ "name" : "Preview", "id" : "Tab1", "icon" : "view"},{ "name" : "HTML", "id" : "Tab2", "icon" : "html"}, { "name" : "Astrojs", "id" : "Tab3", "icon" : "astro"}]}>

<section id ="Tab1-panel" role="tabpanel" data-role="tabpanel">
<div class="flex items-center justify-center p-6">
<Steps />
</div>

</section>

<section id ="Tab2-panel" role="tabpanel" data-role="tabpanel">

<Code code={StepsCode} lang="html" title="StepsVariants.html" wrap="true"/>

</section>

<section id ="Tab3-panel" role="tabpanel" data-role="tabpanel">

<Code code={StepsCodeAstro} lang="astro" title="StepsVariants.astro" wrap="true"/>

</section>

</Tab>



## Alternate Static Steps
