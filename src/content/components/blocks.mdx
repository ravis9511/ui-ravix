# Blocks

The design ideology for ravixUI is cohesiveness and modularity. The base elements of the project are called building blocks. They can be used to make functional blocks or web pages directly. It's based on the atomic design principle but with only two layers.

### Building Blocks

In ravixUI, a building block is regarded as the most fundamental element. It can be likened to the various objects or components within a room, such as switches, light bulbs, sofas, televisions, and computers. While these items may be composed of numerous smaller parts, they are recognized and utilized as unified entities at that particular level of modularity and cohesiveness.

### Functional Blocks

Functional Blocks are constructed by combining multiple building blocks, and they can be easily customized or used out of the box. A typical web page using ravixUI would comprise of several functional blocks working in tandem. For instance, a common example of a functional block is a Hero section, a staple for landing pages.

If you are confused with the terminology, building blocks are the fundamental units. If you modify a building block, it will affect all functional blocks and other building blocks that use that specific building block. However, changing a functional block will not alter any of the building blocks it's composed of. The building blocks remain unchanged, even if the functional block built from them is modified.

### Recommended Approach

If you are looking to start your own design system and or block/component library, the recommended approach is to use the building blocks as the base and modify them based on your needs and preferences.

Directly out of the box, the design guide will have specifications and code for all the building blocks. The functional blocks are available as designs and code but there will be limited documentation support.

Also building blocks and functional blocks are the base terms used for the purpose of the documentation, you are free to change it or continue using it.

### Why Design Guide and Not Design System ?

The design guide lacks many features which would make it a true design system and the purpose of the design guide is to be a base for a design system or to be used directly for smaller projects.
