# Getting Started

If you are an absolute beginner at web development, I would recommend learning basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript basics before starting. But if you don't have the time or just want to setup something like a portfolio or a blog or a landing screen, you can follow this guide where you can follow each step and create a website from scratch.

### What can you expect?

There are HTML and TailwindCSS wrappers for each and every building block you would need to build a page and a few examples you can copy and paste into your project. If a block cannot function with JavaScript it will be mentioned at the top of the block. Out of the box, the design guide has the specifications for all the blocks in ravixUI. For blocks which cannot function without JavaScript, there will be code blocks available in astrojs and svelte. There are hints for accessibility for every block.

### Prerequisites

-   A project with TailwindCSS installed.
-   Basic HTML5, CSS and JavaScript knowledge.

### How can I use this?

However you see fit. The recommended usage is to save a lot of design, documentation and development effort by using the design guide and the blocks as a starting point and build your own system and components.

An example use pattern for a designer and developer using it directly out of the box for a landing page would be something like this :

-   Pick a layout for your web page (grid, flex or a combination of both).
-   Pick a navbar block and customize it.
-   Pick a hero block and customize it or use smaller blocks like Headings, Paragraphs, Buttons and backgrounds to make a the Hero section of your landing page.
-   Pick a feature block and customize it to describe about the product/service/project or use a card block and customize it.
-   Pick a pricing block and customize it to your requirement.
-   Pick a footer block and customize it.

There are design and developer hints for every block available.

### Guide

There is a comprehensive guide available in both written and video format, designed specifically for beginners. This guide covers everything from setting up a code editor to deploying a fully functional website on Cloudflare using Astro.js, a modern static site generator which supports many modern JS frameworks.
