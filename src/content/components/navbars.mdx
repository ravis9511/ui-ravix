# Navbar

Navbars or navigation bars are used to provide
actions to users within a website. They are typically
used at the top of a page to help users navigate
between different sections of the website. Navbars can also include search bars, logos, and other branding elements.

<Accordion
  data={[
    { name : "navbar1",
      title: "Design Hints",
      content:
        "Navbars are a great way to provide users with quick access to important information and actions on a website. They are also a tool which can be used for branding as they tend to be consistent across the website.",
    },
    { name : "navbar1",
      title: "Accessiblity Hints",
      content:
        "For accessibility, it is important to ensure that the blocks inside the navbar like links, buttons, search input etc., are accessible. This can be achieved by using appropriate color contrast, clear and concise language, and hiding the aria for logos if other branding elements like name are present.  Links and Buttons should also have descriptive text to provide context and help users.",
    },

### Navbar Specification

A navbar has a few important considerations :
- The nav container : When using `<nav>` tag, there is no need to set a `role` attribute, but if you use `<div>` or `<section>`, you can set the `role` attribute to `navigation`. Do not use `aria-label` attribute if the you are setting the role or using a `<nav>` tag.
- The links  : The links inside the navbar should have descriptive text to provide context and help users and use `<a>` tag. If you are not using the `<a>` tag, you can set the role to `link`.
- Menus : If you have a submenu or menu inside the navbar it should be accessible.


Note: All the icons used in this section are from Google
Material Icons provided by iconify.design. All the navbars are responsive and adapt to different screen sizes.

      content:
        "While this maybe suitable for certain websites, it is important to consider that if the links go on to another line in smaller devices, you may lose a lot of space for the rest of the content on the page. Consider using a navbar with a hamburger menu for actions and links on smaller screens.",
