# Guidelines

These are the guidelines to make the design and development process easier when using ravixUI.

## Layout

To make the layout responsive the recommended approach is using grid system which is supported in TailwindCSS. The breakpoints like sm, md, lg, xl and 2xl are used in TailwindCSS . For detailed layout specifications and code, you can check the layout section of the documentation.

## Colors

The colors employed in this design system are sourced from the TailwindCSS palette, which provides a comprehensive array of options for customizing the design and branding elements. If you require custom colors beyond those offered, you'll need to incorporate them into TailwindCSS. You can explore the entire color palette and learn how to customize it by visiting the [TailwindCSS websites page on Customizing Colors](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors). Color choices can significantly influence the overall design aesthetic, either enhancing or detracting from it. ravixUI utilizes an indigo color palette, which you can readily adopt as is or modify to suit your preferences.

## Icons and Typography

ravixUI is non opinionated when it comes to icons and typography. It follows the base sizing which is used in TailwindCSS [available in the tailwind documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/font-size). For a good collection of open source fonts which are easy to use and install you can use fontsource. For more information on installation of fonts, you can visit the AstroJS [official documentation on using custom fonts](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/fonts/). The icons used in the project are from [iconify which is available here](https://iconify.design/). They have a vast number of icons from multiple sources available for different use cases and it is simple to use. Generally, it is best to stick to icons from the same source to ensure uniformity. (Please check license details before using any icon or icon pack)

## Dark Mode

All components by default have dark mode support enabled. You can use the visit this page in the tailwind website to understand [how to enable dark mode support for tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/dark-mode) in your application. The components will function with both darkMode options: 'selector' and 'class'.
