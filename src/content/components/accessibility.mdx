# Accessibility

ravixUI tries to adhere to the principle that no ARIA is best the best ARIA. The components are built with the below priority :

1. Semantic HTML where possible.
2. [WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices Guide Patterns](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/) if no semantic HTML is available which can provide the same functionality while adhering to WCAG 2.1 AA level conformance.
3. If there are no WAI-ARIA APG patterns available for a particular component, then it tries to use ARIA in a way that makes sense for the end user while adhering to WCAG 2.1 AA level conformance.

## Tools Used

All the components are manually tested with NVDA and Windows Narrator. The components are also subjected to automated testing using the following tools:

- [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/)
- [axe-core 4.9.1 Chrome Extension Free Version](https://www.deque.com/axe/)
- [IBM Equal Access Accessibility Checker Chrome Extension Version 3.1.71](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ibm-equal-access-accessib/lkcagbfjnkomcinoddgooolagloogehp)

Though not mentioned in the accessibility testing section of each component, the components are also tested using:

- [SilkTide Accessibility Checker Chrome Extension Version 1.0.1](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/silktide-accessibility-ch/mpobacholfblmnpnfbiomjkecoojakah)

## Recommendations

The accessibility of the components is tested in the context it is presented in. It is recommended to test the components in the context of the page they are used in before using them for production.

## Why is Accessibility Important?

Leaving aside legal requirements, building with accessibility in mind is important for the following reasons :

- Improved user experience for everyone. Accessibility features are beneficial for all users irrespective of their abilities.
- Improved inclusivity for your website. Accessibility ensures that your website is usable by everyone irrespective of their abilities.
- The earlier you consider accessibility, the better in the development process.
