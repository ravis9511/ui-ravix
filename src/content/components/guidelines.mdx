# Guidelines

These are the guidelines to make the design and development process easier when using ravixUI.

### Layout

To make the layout responsive the recommended approach is using grid system which is supported both in figma and TailwindCSS. The breakpoints like sm, md, lg, xl and 2xl are used in TailwindCSS and this design system uses the same breakpoints. For detailed layout specifications and code, you can click here

### Colors

The colors employed in this design system are sourced from the TailwindCSS palette, which provides a comprehensive array of options for customizing the design and branding elements. If you require custom colors beyond those offered, you'll need to incorporate them into TailwindCSS. You can explore the entire color palette and learn how to customize it by visiting the TailwindCSS website. Color choices can significantly influence the overall design aesthetic, either enhancing or detracting from it. ravixUI utilizes a base color palette, which you can readily adopt as is or modify to suit your preferences.

### Accessibility

All building blocks are accessible straight out of the box. However certain blocks will require JavaScript to be fully accessible. When customizing the components and using them, you can use tools to check for contrast, readability and ensure that ARIA roles and attributes are assigned properly where applicable.

### Icons and Typography

ravixUI is non opinionated when it comes to icons and typography. It follows the same sizing which is used in TailwindCSS available here. For a good collection of open source fonts which are easy to use and install you can use fontsource. For icons, you can find a large collection of icons using the iconify.design website. They have a vast number of icons from multiple sources available for different use cases and it is simple to use. Generally, it is best to stick to icons from the same source to ensure uniformity. (Please check license details before using any icon or icon pack)
