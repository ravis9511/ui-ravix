# Introduction

ravixUI is an accessibility focused AstroJS based component starter kit which gives you all the code directly out of the box including the JavaScript implementation.

## Why is the code directly available?

ravixUI believes that accessibility is context based and that giving the code directly allows you to edit it and fit your specific use case. Semantic HTML is used for implementation wherever possible. If certain functionalities cannot be achieved with semantic elements, the components follow the WAI-ARIA design patterns for those components with WCAG 2.1 AA level conformance. And if there are no WAI-ARIA APG patterns available, ARIA attributes are used in a way that makes sense for the particular component.

The idea is to set you up with a starting point for building your own accessible website and components.

## Prerequisites

- An AstroJS project with TailwindCSS installed. For AstroJS installation, please refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.astro.build/en/install/auto/). For installation of TailwindCSS integration, please refer to the [@astrojs/tailwind integration documentation](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/tailwind/).
- Basic HTML5, CSS, TailwindCSS and JavaScript knowledge.

## Limitations

Currently the component starter kit is in the early stages of development and there are a few caveats to be aware of :

- Code may require testing and customization to fit your specific use case.
- The Forms components is still in a development stage and is not recommended for any usage.
- The component starter kit does not provide unit tests and hence it is recommended to use only after thorough testing if the particular component depends on JavaScript. 


There are a few more things which are noteworthy :

- It is built using the cloudflare integration (Shouldn't be a issue for most environments. All the pages are static in nature and should translate well regardless of the environment).
- It is tested on Chrome, Firefox, Brave and Edge.(Not tested on Safari yet. Planned for the future)
- It is made with astroJS in mind and uses astroJS for the build process, so it may not work with other frameworks or static site generators.
- There is no guide available yet. (Planned for the future)
