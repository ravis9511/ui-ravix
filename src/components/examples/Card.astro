            While, there are no hard and fast rules for paragraphs, some commonly used guidelines are based on width and spacing. The sweet spot for paragraph width is between 600px and 750px for large screens, which is commonly seen in most popular blogs, articles, content pieces, etc. For smaller screens like mobile, width does not matter as much, but margins and padding should be used to create white space and make the text more readable.
