# Progress

Progress bars are used to indicate the progress of a task or the completion of a process. They are commonly used in forms, such as in file uploads or in the loading of content. Progress bars can also be used to indicate reading progress for content such as blogs, articles, documentation, or other text-based content.

<Accordion
  data={[
    {
      name: "progress1",
      title: "Design Hints",
      content:
        "Progress bars are a great way to provide users with a visual representation of the progress of a task or the completion of a process. They are also a good way to make the interface more visually appealing and engaging.",
    },
    {
      name: "progress1",
      title: "Accessiblity Hints",
      content:
        "For accessibility, we assign the `progressbar` role to the div and use the `aria-valuemin`, `aria-valuemax`, and `aria-valuenow` attributes to indicate the current progress of the task. In the examples below, all the other elements other than the progress bar are not focusable and have aria-hidden set to true. To provide more information about the progress bar, we can use the aria-label attribute on the div to provide a description of the task or the process.",
    },
